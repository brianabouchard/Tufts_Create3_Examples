# Jupyter Notebook Examples

The beauty of a Juypter Notebook is that it simplifies the coding process by bypassing the compiling, building, package hastle. Don't worry you will get to that later. 

1. Install Jupyter Notebook in Terminal:
```
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
2. Navigate to the jupyter notebook example directory 
```
cd ./Tufts_Create3_Examples/jupyter_notebook_examples
```
4. Open the files by typing:
```
jupyter notebook
``` 
5. Change the Namepsace in each file to match the Namespace of your CreateÂ®3 robot.
6. Run the code by clicking on the cell (so that it highlights blue) and pressing the run button. 

Write your own code by adding a cell at the bottom of any file, typing out your code, selecting the cell so that it turns blue, and pressing the run button.
