# Jupyter Notebook Examples

The beauty of a Juypter Notebook is that it simplifies the coding process by bypassing the compiling, building, package hastle. Don't worry you will get to that later. 

To run the Jupyter Notebook Scripts all you need to do is

1. Download the zip file of this repo & unzip it. 
2. Remove the jupyter_notebook_examples folder and place it in your home directory. (It doesn't matter what you do with the other files. Delete them for all I care.)
3. 
```
cd jupyter_notebook_examples
```
4. 
```
jupyter notebook
``` 
5. Change the Namepsace in each file to match the Namespace of your CreateÂ® 3 robot.
6. Run the code by clicking on the cell (so that it highlights blue) and pressing the run button. 

Write your own code by adding a cell at the bottom of any file, typing out your code, selecting the cell so that it turns blue, and pressing the run button.
