# Python Mini-Examples Library

In order to send more complex directions to the Create® 3 robot, we must use the ROS2 Python client library (rclpy). This client library allows us to launch nodes, publish and subscribe to topics, and send goals to the Create® 3 all at once. 

This direcory will be a workspace and package that you can clone onto your machine, build, and then use to run the examples (or finish the incomplete ones). 

For more conceptual information about the ROS2 Python client library, workspaces, and packages please check out our handy dandy [website](https://katewujciak1.wixsite.com/projectcreate/running-py-files-with-ros2).
