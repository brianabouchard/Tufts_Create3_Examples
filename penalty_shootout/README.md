# The iRobot速 Create速 3 is the new Alex Morgan, Mo Salah or Edouard Mendy. 

Design soccer players (that will sit on top of your Create速 3 robot) to shoot a penalty kick or save one and code your Create速 3 robot to fake out the opponent. 

Rules for the shootout are as follow: 
1. Goalkeepers can only move side to side. 
2. Shooters must shoot before taped line.
3. Both teams must press run on their code at the same time. 
4. The ball must be in your contraption before your start the code. 
5. No teleop. 

This folder contains a lightly set up python script (and the same script in jupyter notebook form) for you to edit. Then either run it in the jupyter notebook or put it in the example_package and assign it an executable name to run it there. 

For examples of how to send multiple actions in one script please reference [action_drive_sqaure.py](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/example_package/example_package/action_drive_square.py) and [action_drive_square_2.py](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/example_package/example_package/action_drive_square_2.py).
