## Using Airtable to control iRobot™ Education's Create®3 Robot 

A more advanced way to do telerobotics is to use Airtable to remotely control your Create®3 robot. Airtable is a cloud collaboration service that lets you store
information in a visual environment. The Airtable API environment allows you to get information from the table and import it into your python code with a few simple
commands. In this example, I created an Airtable with 6 different cells. The cells correspond to x,y and z angular and linear velocities. By putting numbers into these
cells we can then change the linear and angular velocities of the wheels of the robot. In other words, drive it around.
